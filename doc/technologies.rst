Technologies and Programming Languages Used
===========================================

The project has been developed using a variety of modern and efficient technologies and programming languages, ensuring a solid and flexible foundation for the web application. Below are the main technologies used in the project:

- **Django**
- **Docker**
  To ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments, the project uses Docker. This facilitates the creation, deployment, and execution of the application through the use of containers, providing an isolated environment that contains all the necessary dependencies.
- **GitHub Actions**
  For automating workflows such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), GitHub Actions is utilized. This tool allows for the automation of tests, building Docker images, and deployment of the application, ensuring that every change in the code is automatically built, tested, and ready for efficient deployment.
- **Render**
  As the deployment platform, Render has been chosen for its simplicity and ease of use in deploying web applications. Render automates the deployment process, allowing the application to be accessible online with minimal configuration.
- **Sentry**
  For real-time error monitoring and management, the project integrates Sentry.

In addition to the main technologies mentioned, the project makes use of various additional libraries and tools specified in the ``requirements.txt`` file, such as ``pytest`` for unit testing, ``flake8`` for linting, and ``Sphinx`` for documentation generation, among others.
